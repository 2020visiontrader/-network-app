/**
 * ONBOARDING IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
 * 
 * Based on our analysis, here's what you need to do:
 * 
 * 1. APPLY THE DATABASE MIGRATION
 *    - Run the updated SQL in complete_onboarding_migration.sql
 *    - The key fix: Function now checks for existing emails and preserves IDs
 *    - This solves the "duplicate email key" error
 * 
 * 2. CONFIRM THE APP CODE IS CORRECT
 *    - FounderService.js: ✓ Uses maybeSingle() instead of single() now
 *    - OnboardingForm.js: ✓ Correctly passes user ID & email to the service
 *    - App.js: ✓ Now wraps OnboardingForm in a navigation stack for redirects
 * 
 * 3. TEST THE APP ON DEVICE
 *    - Use the Expo app to test the full flow
 *    - The database tests are hitting connection issues from Node.js scripts
 *    - Testing through the actual app is more reliable
 * 
 * 4. VERIFY NAVIGATION REDIRECT WORKS
 *    - After onboarding completes, check that it redirects to Dashboard
 *    - For future logins, check that it skips onboarding for completed users
 * 
 * KEY IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
 * 1. Updated database function to handle email conflicts properly
 * 2. Improved error handling in FounderService.js
 * 3. Enhanced navigation with proper redirects after onboarding
 * 4. RLS policies are now correctly set up
