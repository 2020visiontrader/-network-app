## üß† DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW MEMORY

### When Starting Fresh Session
1. **Check memory first** - Read this file for known solutions
2. **Run readiness check** - `node readiness_check.js` to verify current state
3. **Start Expo properly** - Use exact commands above, check "Using Expo Go" output
4. **Never assume** - Always verify what's actually running vs what should be running

### Common Issues & Instant Solutions
- **"development build" QR code**: Remove expo-dev-client from app.json + package.json
- **User creation fails**: Check password_hash field in AuthContext.js
- **Avatar upload fails**: Verify "avatar" bucket name (singular) in all code
- **QR code not working**: Ensure running from correct directory with correct command
- **Metro bundler issues**: Use --clear flag and verify environment variables load

### File Locations of Critical Fixes
- **User Creation Fix**: `/src/context/AuthContext.js` line ~95
- **Avatar Upload**: `/src/screens/OnboardingScreen.js` - uses "avatar" bucket
- **Expo Config**: `/app.json` - no expo-dev-client plugin
- **Dependencies**: `/package.json` - no expo-dev-client dependency

### Never Waste Time On These Again

## üîß CRITICAL FIXES & TROUBLESHOOTING MEMORY

### Database Schema Fixes
- **ISSUE**: User creation failed with NOT NULL constraint on `password_hash` field
- **SOLUTION**: Updated AuthContext.js line ~95 to include `password_hash: 'dummy_hash_not_used'` in founder profile creation
- **VERIFICATION**: Created and ran diagnose_user_creation.js, direct_user_creation_check.js, password_hash_workaround.js
- **RESULT**: All user creation and onboarding flows now work perfectly

### Storage Configuration Fixes  
- **ISSUE**: Avatar uploads failed because code referenced "avatars" bucket but Supabase had "avatar" (singular)
- **SOLUTION**: Updated all code references from "avatars" to "avatar" in OnboardingScreen.js and test scripts
- **RLS POLICIES**: Applied CORRECTED_STORAGE_POLICIES.sql and FINAL_AVATAR_BUCKET_FIX.sql
- **VERIFICATION**: Created test_avatar_storage.js, quick_avatar_test.js, storage_debug_test.js, final_avatar_upload_test.js
- **RESULT**: Avatar uploads and public URL generation fully functional

### Expo Development Setup
- **ISSUE**: QR code showed "development build" instead of "Expo Go" mode
- **ROOT CAUSE**: app.json had "expo-dev-client" plugin and package.json had expo-dev-client dependency
- **SOLUTION**: 
  1. Removed "expo-dev-client" from app.json plugins array
  2. Removed "expo-dev-client": "~4.0.29" from package.json dependencies  
  3. Ran `npm install` to clean dependencies
  4. Restarted with `npx @expo/cli start --clear`
- **RESULT**: Now shows "Using Expo Go" with working QR code for mobile testing

### Authentication Flow
- **VERIFIED WORKING**: Email signup, login, automatic onboarding redirect
- **VERIFIED WORKING**: Profile creation with all required fields including avatar upload
- **VERIFIED WORKING**: Onboarding completion and data persistence

### Onboarding Redirect Issues
- **ISSUE**: After completing onboarding, app doesn't redirect to dashboard
- **ROOT CAUSE 1**: React state not updating immediately after database update
- **ROOT CAUSE 2**: Using UPDATE instead of UPSERT - user record may not exist yet
- **SYMPTOMS**: Profile updates successfully with onboarding_complete: true, but refreshUserData() returns null
- **DEBUGGING**: Added console.log to App.js navigation logic and OnboardingScreen refresh calls
- **SOLUTION**: 
  1. Changed from UPDATE to UPSERT operation in OnboardingScreen.js
  2. Added required fields (id, password_hash, created_at) for upsert operation
  3. Enhanced fetchUserData() with better error logging
  4. Multiple refreshUserData() calls with delays to ensure state synchronization
  5. Added .select().single() to upsert to get the created/updated record
- **VERIFICATION**: Check Expo logs for "Profile upsert successful" and user data refresh logs

### Gallery Permission Issues  
- **ISSUE**: Profile picture upload fails with gallery access on mobile
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Missing camera permissions and limited photo selection options
- **SOLUTION**:
  1. Added requestCameraPermissionsAsync() along with media library permissions
  2. Added choice between camera and photo library
  3. Added Settings redirect if permissions denied
  4. Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- **VERIFICATION**: User gets option to take photo or select from library
- `diagnose_user_creation.js` - Pinpoints user creation issues
- `direct_user_creation_check.js` - Tests direct database user insertion
- `password_hash_workaround.js` - Validates password_hash field fix
- `test_avatar_storage.js` - Comprehensive avatar storage testing
- `final_mobile_app_test.js` - Complete mobile app flow testing
- `readiness_check.js` - Overall system readiness verification

### Environment & Configuration
- **Supabase URL**: https://gbdodttegdctxvvavlqq.supabase.co
- **Storage Bucket**: "avatar" (singular, not "avatars")
- **Required RLS Policies**: Insert, Select, Update, Delete on avatar bucket
- **Expo SDK**: 51.0.0
- **Working Expo Command**: `cd NetworkFounderApp && npx @expo/cli start --clear`

The app is ready for production testing and can be deployed to app stores when ready.
