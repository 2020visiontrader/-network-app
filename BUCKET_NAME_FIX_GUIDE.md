# üîß FIXING BUCKET NAME MISMATCH

## üìä **The Issue:**
- Your bucket is named **"avatar"** (singular)
- The code was looking for **"avatars"** (plural)
- Bucket still not appearing in API calls

## ‚úÖ **What I've Fixed:**
1. **Updated OnboardingScreen.js** - Changed `'avatars'` to `'avatar'`
2. **Created corrected SQL policies** - For "avatar" bucket
3. **Updated all storage references** - To use correct bucket name

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

### **Step 1: Run Corrected SQL Script**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste `CORRECTED_STORAGE_POLICIES.sql`
3. Click **Run**
4. This will create policies for the "avatar" bucket

### **Step 2: Verify Bucket in Dashboard**
1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase dashboard
2. Confirm bucket name is exactly **"avatar"**
3. Verify it's set to **Public**
4. Try manually uploading a test image

### **Step 3: Test Your App**
Your mobile app should now work with avatar uploads!

## üì± **TESTING:**

### **Test Avatar Upload:**
1. Open your app: http://localhost:8081
2. Go through onboarding
3. Try uploading a profile picture
4. Should work now with the corrected bucket name

### **If Still Issues:**
The bucket might need to be recreated. Try:
1. Delete the current "avatar" bucket
2. Create a new one named exactly **"avatar"**
3. Set it to **Public**
4. Re-run the SQL policies

## üöÄ **CURRENT STATUS:**

‚úÖ **Code Fixed**: OnboardingScreen.js updated for "avatar" bucket
‚úÖ **SQL Policies**: Ready to run for correct bucket name  
‚úÖ **Mobile App**: Running and ready for testing
‚ö†Ô∏è **Bucket**: May need verification/recreation in dashboard

---

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Run SQL**: `CORRECTED_STORAGE_POLICIES.sql` in Supabase
2. **Verify Bucket**: Check it exists and is public in dashboard
3. **Test App**: Try avatar upload in onboarding
4. **Full Test**: Complete authentication and onboarding flow

**Your app should now work perfectly with avatar uploads!**
