# Network App - Critical Fixes for User ID Issues

This directory contains all necessary fixes to resolve the critical issues with the Network App's onboarding and authentication flow.

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **Database Schema Issues**
   - `user_id` field in founders table was NULL in some cases
   - `handle_new_user` trigger function wasn't correctly populating `user_id`
   - Multiple overloaded versions of `upsert_founder_onboarding` function were causing ambiguity
   - Missing constraints and indexes for data integrity

2. **Auth Flow Problems**
   - Improper mapping between `auth.users.id` and `founders.user_id`
   - Frontend code looking up founders by wrong field in some cases
   - Email confirmation issues (temporarily disabled)

## Files in this Directory

- `comprehensive_database_fix.sql` - Main fix script to run in Supabase SQL Editor
- `test_auth_flow_after_fix.js` - Script to test the auth flow after applying fixes
- `FIX_APPLICATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide for applying and testing fixes
- `verify_database_fix.js` - Script to verify database schema changes

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. **Run the Database Fix Script**
   - Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `comprehensive_database_fix.sql`
   - This will fix all database functions, triggers, and constraints

2. **Verify the Fixes**
   - Run `node verify_database_fix.js`
   - This will check if all database changes were applied correctly

3. **Test the Complete Auth Flow**
   - Run `node test_auth_flow_after_fix.js`
   - This will create a test user and verify the entire auth/onboarding flow

4. **Update Frontend Code (if needed)**
   - Ensure your frontend code is looking up founders by the correct field
   - Make sure all calls to database functions use the correct parameters

5. **Manual Testing**
   - Test the signup flow in the real app
   - Complete the onboarding process
   - Verify you can access your profile

## Technical Details

### Key Function Changes

1. **`handle_new_user` function**
   - Now correctly sets both `id` and `user_id` to the same value (the auth user's ID)
   - Added error handling to prevent failed signups

2. **`upsert_founder_onboarding` function**
   - Consolidated multiple overloaded versions into a single correct version
   - Improved error handling and validation
   - Ensures `user_id` is properly set during onboarding

### Database Schema Improvements

1. **Constraints and Indexes**
   - Added NOT NULL constraint to `user_id` column
   - Added unique index on `user_id` for better performance
   - Fixed any existing data with NULL values

2. **RLS Policies**
   - Updated RLS policies to work correctly with `user_id`
   - Added admin policies for better management

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check the Supabase logs for any errors from the functions or triggers
2. Run the verification scripts again and note any failures
3. Verify RLS policies are correctly configured
4. Check frontend console logs for any errors

## Next Steps

Once everything is working:

1. Consider re-enabling email confirmation if needed for production
2. Set up custom SMTP if you experience email delivery issues
3. Add additional validation to the onboarding form
