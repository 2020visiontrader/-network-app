# NetworkFounderApp Implementation Status

#### üß™ Verification Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `test-end-to-end-flow.js` | Verifies complete user flow from signup to profile update |
| `ultimate-rls-verification.js` | Comprehensive test of RLS policies with explicit anonymous vs. authenticated clients |
| `enhanced-rls-verification.js` | Tests RLS policies for each operation type |
| `verify-rls-configuration.js` | Basic check if RLS policies are implemented |
| `find-single-calls.js` | Helps identify any remaining `.single()` calls |eted Tasks

### Database and Query Fixes
- Replaced all `.single()` calls with `.maybeSingle()` to prevent PGRST116 errors
- Fixed schema cache issues and column name mismatches
- Standardized on `profile_visible` column (removed conflicting `is_visible`)
- Implemented comprehensive RLS policies for the founders table
- Created SQL scripts to fix RLS policy conflicts

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created end-to-end test script that verifies the complete user flow
- Created RLS policy verification script
- Implemented robust test infrastructure with proper UUID generation
- Added retry logic and wait-for-condition patterns to handle race conditions

### Documentation
- Created extensive documentation for all fixes and best practices
- Documented working configurations and error solutions
- Created checklists for environment setup and verification

## üü† Remaining Tasks

### RLS Policy Fix
- ‚úÖ Initial RLS policy script `fix-founders-rls-policies.sql` was run
- ‚úÖ Enhanced RLS policy script `enhanced-founders-rls-policies.sql` was run
- ‚úÖ Final RLS policy script `final-founders-rls-policies.sql` was run
- Testing revealed some persistent issues with access control
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Run the `ultimate-founders-rls-policies.sql` script in the Supabase SQL Editor
- This ultimate script combines explicit privilege management with RLS policies
- Verify the fix with the `ultimate-rls-verification.js` script which has more comprehensive tests

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete end-to-end testing of all user flows using the `test-end-to-end-flow.js` script
- Test with real user credentials for fully authenticated flows

### Maintenance
- Regularly run verification scripts to ensure continued compliance
- Update documentation as new patterns are established
- Ensure all new code follows the established patterns:
  - Use `.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()`
  - Implement proper error handling
  - Follow RLS policy best practices

## üìÇ Documentation Resources

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `docs/solutions/single-vs-maybeSingle.md` | Guide on using `.maybeSingle()` |
| `docs/solutions/rls-policies-fix.md` | Documentation on RLS policy implementation |

| `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` | Environment setup instructions |
| `docs/FINAL_CHECKLIST.md` | Final implementation checklist |

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Run the ultimate SQL script to properly fix the RLS policies:
   ```
   ultimate-founders-rls-policies.sql
   ```

2. Verify the ultimate RLS policies with the comprehensive verification script:
   ```
   node ultimate-rls-verification.js
   ```

3. Run a complete end-to-end test:
   ```
   node test-end-to-end-flow.js
   ```

4. Document any additional findings and update the documentation as needed
