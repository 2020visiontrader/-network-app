# RLS Policy Fix Success Confirmation

## âœ… Fix Applied Successfully

The RLS (Row Level Security) policies have been successfully fixed and implemented. 

## Key Changes

1. **Simplified SQL syntax**:
   - More concise and readable policy declarations
   - Consistent pattern across all tables
   - Used `IN` operator for role checks instead of multiple OR conditions

2. **Fixed INSERT policies**:
   - Properly implemented `WITH CHECK` clauses
   - Fixed column references (using `founder_a_id` in connections table)
   - Applied consistent security model across tables

3. **Schema improvements**:
   - Added NOT NULL constraints to critical columns
   - Set appropriate default values
   - Migrated visibility data from legacy columns

## Understanding PostgreSQL RLS Behavior

It's important to understand how PostgreSQL stores and displays RLS policies:

1. **Policies for SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE operations**: 
   - Use the `USING` clause
   - Conditions appear in the `qual` column in `pg_policies` view

2. **Policies for INSERT operations**:
   - Use the `WITH CHECK` clause
   - Conditions appear in the `with_check` column in `pg_policies` view
   - The `qual` column will show as `NULL` for INSERT policies (this is normal)

When checking your policies, always include `with_check` in your query:

```sql
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM
    pg_policies
WHERE
    schemaname = 'public'
    AND tablename IN ('founders', 'connections');
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test your application** to ensure the security model is working as expected
2. **Monitor database performance** with the new policies in place
3. **Document these changes** in your project documentation

## Conclusion

Your application's data security has been significantly improved with these policy fixes. The RLS policies now properly restrict data access based on user identity and role, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

The simplified SQL syntax will also make future maintenance easier and less error-prone.
