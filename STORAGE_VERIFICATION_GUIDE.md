# 🔍 STORAGE BUCKET VERIFICATION GUIDE

## 📊 **Current Test Results:**
- ✅ Storage system accessible
- ✅ Public URL generation works
- ❌ Bucket not found in list
- ❌ Upload test failed

## 🎯 **This Means:**
The bucket path is recognized by Supabase, but the bucket either:
1. Wasn't fully created
2. Has permission issues
3. Isn't properly configured

---

## 🔧 **VERIFICATION STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Double-Check Bucket Creation**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Make sure you're in the correct project: `gbdodttegdctxvvavlqq`
3. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Look for a bucket named **"avatars"**

**What you should see:**
- Bucket name: `avatars`
- Status: Public
- Files: 0 (empty is fine)

### **Step 2: Verify Bucket Settings**
If the bucket exists:
1. Click on the **"avatars"** bucket
2. Check the settings (gear icon or settings tab)
3. Verify these settings:
   - **Public bucket**: ✅ CHECKED
   - **File size limit**: 50MB or higher
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*` or blank

### **Step 3: Test Manual Upload**
1. In the avatars bucket
2. Try to upload a test image manually
3. If upload works → bucket is properly configured
4. If upload fails → check permissions

---

## 🚀 **QUICK FIXES:**

### **If Bucket Doesn't Exist:**
```
1. Go to Storage > Create bucket
2. Name: avatars (exactly, lowercase)
3. Public: ✅ (checked)
4. Click Create bucket
```

### **If Bucket Exists But Has Issues:**
```
1. Click on avatars bucket
2. Go to Settings/Configuration
3. Enable "Public bucket"
4. Save changes
```

### **If Policies Are Missing:**
The SQL script should have created them, but verify in:
```
Storage > Policies > Check for avatar-related policies
```

---

## 🧪 **RE-TEST AFTER FIXING:**

```bash
# Run this after making changes:
node detailed_storage_test.js
```

**Expected results after fix:**
- ✅ Storage system accessible
- ✅ Avatars bucket found in list
- ✅ Public URL generation works
- ✅ Test upload successful

---

## 📝 **COMMON ISSUES:**

1. **Wrong Project**: Make sure you're in project `gbdodttegdctxvvavlqq`
2. **Case Sensitive**: Bucket name must be exactly `avatars` (lowercase)
3. **Not Public**: Bucket must be set to public for avatar URLs to work
4. **Permissions**: Anon key needs read access to storage

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

You'll know it's working when:
- Bucket appears in Storage dashboard
- Manual image upload works
- `detailed_storage_test.js` shows all ✅
- Mobile app can upload avatars

**Next**: After fixing, test the complete mobile app authentication and onboarding flow!
