# ðŸ”§ FIXING METRO CONNECTION ISSUE

## Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. Network/Firewall Issues
The most common cause is network connectivity between your device and computer.

**Solution**: Try these connection methods:

#### Option A: Use Tunnel Mode (Most Reliable)

# Then restart with tunnel:
npx expo start --tunnel
```

#### Option B: Use LAN Mode with Correct IP
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)  
# Then restart with LAN:
npx expo start --lan
```

- This opens the app in your browser at http://localhost:8082
- Perfect for testing authentication and onboarding
