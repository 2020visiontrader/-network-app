# Database Verification Results

## Summary
The verification process identified several key areas that are working correctly and a few that need attention.

## What's Working Correctly
- ✅ Database connection is successful with provided API keys
- ✅ Schema structure for `founders` and `connections` tables exists
- ✅ User creation and authentication flow works properly
- ✅ Basic visibility policies for founder profiles are functioning
- ✅ Helper functions like `is_valid_uuid` and `refresh_schema_cache` are operational

## Issues Identified
1. **RLS Policy Issues**
   - ❌ The connection creation policy is too restrictive, preventing authenticated users from creating connections
   - ❌ The error message indicates: "new row violates row-level security policy for table connections"

2. **Schema Issues**
   - ⚠️ The `founders` table has both `profile_visible` and `is_visible` columns
   - The legacy `is_visible` column should be migrated fully to `profile_visible` and then dropped

## Recommendations

### Fix Connection RLS Policies
The RLS policy for connections table needs to be updated to allow authenticated users to create connections. The current policy is rejecting valid connection attempts. The SQL to fix this might look like:

```sql
-- Drop existing restrictive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS connections_insert_policy ON connections;

-- Create a more permissive policy
CREATE POLICY connections_insert_policy
  ON connections
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND
    (founder_a_id IN (SELECT id FROM founders WHERE user_id = auth.uid()))
  );
```

### Complete Schema Migration
Finish the migration from `is_visible` to `profile_visible`:

```sql
-- Update any remaining records
UPDATE founders 
SET profile_visible = is_visible 
WHERE profile_visible IS NULL;

-- Remove the legacy column
ALTER TABLE founders DROP COLUMN is_visible;
```

### Test with authenticated users
When testing connection creation, ensure:
1. The user is properly authenticated
2. The user owns the founder profile they're using as `founder_a_id`
3. The connection doesn't already exist

## Next Steps
1. Apply the RLS policy fixes
2. Complete the schema migration
3. Run the verification script again to confirm all issues are resolved

## Additional Notes
- All test data has been cleaned up after verification
- The current database structure supports the core functionality but could benefit from these improvements
