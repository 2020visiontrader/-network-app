# Final Implementation Checklist

## Column Standardization ✅

- [x] Fixed `is_visible` vs `profile_visible` column inconsistency
- [x] Updated all code to use `profile_visible` consistently
- [x] Dropped the redundant `is_visible` column
- [x] Verified the column is accessible and works correctly

## RLS Policy Implementation ✅

- [x] Implemented restrictive policy for anonymous access
- [x] Created appropriate permissive policies for authenticated users
- [x] Added service role access for admin operations
- [x] Verified policies work as expected

## Best Practices Implementation ⏳

- [ ] Replace all `.single()` calls with `.maybeSingle()`
- [ ] Update error handling to check for null data
- [ ] Ensure proper authenticated context for all operations
- [ ] Use service role for admin operations

## Documentation ✅

- [x] Created column standardization guide
- [x] Created RLS policy implementation guide
- [x] Created `.single()` vs `.maybeSingle()` pattern guide
- [x] Updated environment setup documentation
- [x] Created quick reference guide

## Testing ⏳

- [x] Verified anonymous access is properly restricted
- [x] Verified schema fixes work correctly
- [ ] Test with authenticated user credentials
- [ ] Verify end-to-end flows (onboarding, profile update, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Authenticated Testing**
   - Update test-authenticated-rls.js with valid credentials
   - Run and verify authenticated access works correctly

2. **Replace All `.single()` Calls**
   - Run find-single-calls.sh to locate instances
   - Update with proper error handling

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete onboarding flow
   - Test profile update flow
   - Test discovery features

## Final Verification

Once all steps are complete, run the following final verification:

```bash
# 1. Schema verification
node verify-schema-fix.js

# 2. Anonymous access test
node test-anonymous-access.js

# 3. Authenticated access test
node test-authenticated-rls.js

# 4. Onboarding flow test
node test-onboarding-flow.js
```

All tests should pass successfully to confirm the implementation is complete.
