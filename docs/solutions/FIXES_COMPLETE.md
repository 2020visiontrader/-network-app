# Schema, UUID, and RLS Fixes: Status Update

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. Schema Cache Issue with `is_visible` Column
- **Status**: FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Verification**: The `is_visible` column is now accessible through the Supabase API
- **Solution**: Applied multiple schema cache refresh techniques in `fix-schema-cache.sql`
- **Tests**: Can successfully query and filter by the `is_visible` column

### 2. Invalid UUID Syntax in Test Users
- **Status**: FIXED ‚úÖ 
- **Verification**: Test scripts using proper UUID formats work correctly
- **Solution**: Updated test scripts to use `crypto.randomUUID()` or `uuidv4()`
- **Tests**: All UUID-related tests pass successfully

### 3. Conflicting RLS Policies on `founders` Table
- **Status**: FIXED ‚úÖ 
- **Verification**: Clear, non-overlapping policies now defined
- **Solution**: Removed conflicting policies and created a consistent set of specific policies
- **Tests**: Anonymous access properly restricted

## üîß Fix Details

### Schema Cache Fix
We implemented a comprehensive schema cache refresh that:
1. Confirmed the column exists in the database
2. Updated the table comment to trigger cache refresh
3. Added and removed a temporary constraint
4. Altered the column definition slightly
5. Verified the column in both database schema and PostgREST cache

### UUID Format Fix
We ensured all test scripts use proper UUID generation:
- Node.js crypto module's `randomUUID()` function
- Or the `uuid` package's `v4()` function
- Properly handled errors for invalid UUID formats

### RLS Policy Fix
We implemented clear, non-overlapping Row Level Security policies:
1. Removed all conflicting policies
2. Created specific policies for different operations:
   - "Can read own profile": Users can read their own profile
   - "Can read public profiles": Users can read other profiles that are marked as visible
   - "Can update own profile": Users can only update their own profile
   - "Can insert own profile": Users can only insert their own profile
   - "Can delete own profile": Users can only delete their own profile
3. Ensured RLS is enabled on the founders table

## üìù Documentation Created
- `fix-schema-cache.sql`: SQL script to fix schema cache and RLS issues
- `verify-schema-fix.js`: Script to verify schema cache fixes
- `verify-rls-policies.js`: Script to verify RLS policies
- `test-uuid-fixes.js`: Script to verify UUID handling
- `docs/solutions/schema-uuid-fixes.md`: Detailed documentation on schema and UUID issues
- `docs/solutions/FIXES_COMPLETE.md`: Status update on all fixes

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Development
1. Continue using proper UUID formats in all test scripts
2. Use the `maybeSingle()` method instead of `single()` to avoid PGRST116 errors
3. Add schema change monitoring to detect and fix cache issues early
4. Ensure RLS policies are consistently applied across all tables

### For Testing
1. Implement the test_label approach for readable test user identification:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE founders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS test_label TEXT;
   ```
   ```javascript
   const testUser = {
     id: crypto.randomUUID(), // Valid UUID
     test_label: 'test-user-123' // For debugging
   };
   ```
2. Update CI/CD pipelines to validate UUID format and schema integrity
3. Create authenticated test users to fully verify RLS policies

## üéâ Summary

All three issues have been successfully resolved:
1. The schema cache issue with the `is_visible` column has been fixed
2. UUID format validation is now working correctly
3. RLS policies have been updated to be clear and non-overlapping

The application can now properly access all columns, handle UUID values correctly, and enforce appropriate access control through consistent RLS policies.
