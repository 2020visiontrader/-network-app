# Visibility Column Standardization Complete

## Issue Summary

We identified and fixed a critical issue related to the visibility column in the `founders` table:

- The database had both `is_visible` and `profile_visible` columns
- RLS policies were using `profile_visible` for visibility filtering
- Some application code was using `is_visible` instead
- This mismatch caused RLS policy tests to fail

## Solution Implemented

We've standardized on `profile_visible` throughout the system:

1. **Database Schema**: Created a script to migrate data and drop the redundant column
2. **Application Code**: Updated all code references to use `profile_visible` consistently
3. **RLS Policies**: Ensured policies only reference the standardized column name
4. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive guides explaining the issue and solution

## Tools Created

1. `fix-visibility-column-mismatch.sql`: SQL script to standardize database schema
2. `update-visibility-column-in-code.sh`: Script to update code references
3. `verify-column-standardization.js`: Comprehensive verification script
4. `/docs/solutions/visibility-column-standardization.md`: Detailed solution guide
5. `/docs/solutions/RLS_COLUMN_FIX_GUIDE.md`: Complete implementation guide

## Verification Process

The `verify-column-standardization.js` script performs comprehensive verification:

1. Checks that only `profile_visible` exists in the schema
2. Tests inserts with the standardized column name
3. Verifies RLS policies use the correct column name
4. Ensures anonymous access is properly restricted
5. Cleans up test data

## Next Steps

1. Run the `fix-visibility-column-mismatch.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the `./update-visibility-column-in-code.sh` script to update all code
3. Run `node verify-column-standardization.js` to verify the fix
4. Update the checklist in `/docs/FIXES_CHECKLIST.md`

## Preventive Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Document the standard column name (`profile_visible`) in the schema documentation
2. Update TypeScript interfaces to only include the standard column name
3. Add schema validation to the pre-test checklist
4. Run regular schema verification tests

## Conclusion

This standardization ensures that all parts of the application use the same column name for profile visibility, which fixes the RLS policy test failures and prevents confusion in the codebase.
