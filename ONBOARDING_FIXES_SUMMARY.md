# Onboarding Flow Fixes Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Ensuring auth.uid() is used for founder ID
- Verified that `FounderService.js` uses the authenticated user's ID when inserting/updating records
- Confirmed that `upsertFounderOnboarding` function correctly passes `user.id` as the ID field
- Added fallback in `FounderService.js` that explicitly sets `id: userId` when using regular upsert

### 2. Simplified Sign-Up vs Onboarding Form
- Removed redundant fields from the sign-up form:
  - Removed "Full Name" field
  - Removed "Company Name" field
  - Kept only Email, Password, and Confirm Password
- Onboarding Form retained all profile fields:
  - Full name
  - LinkedIn URL
  - Location (City)
  - Company Name
  - Role
  - Industry
  - Bio
  - Tags/Interests
  - Profile visibility
- Updated the auth sign-up flow to no longer create a partial founder record during sign-up

### 3. Fixed Redirect After Profile Completion
- Added navigation.replace('MainTabs') as a fallback if navigation.reset() fails
- Enhanced the navigation logic in App.js to check onboarding status more effectively
- Added explicit navigation logic to redirect completed users away from onboarding if they end up there

## Manual Verification Steps

1. **Test New User Flow**:
   - Sign up with a new email
   - Verify you're redirected to onboarding
   - Complete onboarding
   - Verify you're redirected to the dashboard
   - Sign out and sign back in
   - Verify you go directly to dashboard (not onboarding)

2. **Test Existing User Flow**:
   - Sign in with an existing account that has completed onboarding
   - Verify you go directly to dashboard
   - Check database to confirm auth.uid() matches the user's ID in the founders table

3. **Simplified Sign-Up Form**:
   - Verify the sign-up form only shows:
     - Email
     - Password
     - Confirm Password

## Technical Implementation

### Database Access
- All RLS policies ensure rows can only be modified where id = auth.uid()
- User ID is always passed explicitly in database operations
- The upsert_founder_onboarding function provides server-side validation

### Navigation Flow
- Auth state is monitored to determine appropriate screens
- Onboarding completion redirects to dashboard
- Navigation.reset() is used to prevent back navigation to onboarding

### Data Integrity
- Email uniqueness is preserved
- Auth user ID is always used as the founder record ID
- Onboarding_completed flag controls navigation flow
