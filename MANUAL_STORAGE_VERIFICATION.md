# 🔍 MANUAL STORAGE BUCKET VERIFICATION

Since the automated tests are having issues, let's verify your storage bucket manually:

## 📋 **MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Check Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `gbdodttegdctxvvavlqq`
3. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Look for buckets in the list

### **Step 2: Verify Bucket Details**
If you see a bucket (whether it's "avatar", "avatars", or another name):
1. **Click on the bucket name**
2. **Check settings**:
   - Is it marked as "Public"? ✅
   - Can you see any files inside?
   - Are there any error messages?

### **Step 3: Test Manual Upload**
1. Inside the bucket, try to **upload a test image**
2. If upload succeeds → bucket is working
3. If upload fails → note the error message

### **Step 4: Check URL Access**
1. After uploading a test image
2. Right-click the image and "Copy URL"
3. Try opening the URL in a new browser tab
4. If image loads → public access is working

## 🎯 **WHAT TO TELL ME:**

Please let me know:
1. **Do you see any buckets in the Storage section?**
2. **What is the exact name of the bucket you see?**
3. **Is it marked as "Public"?**
4. **Can you upload a test image successfully?**
5. **Can you access the uploaded image via its public URL?**

## 🚀 **MEANWHILE - TEST YOUR APP:**

Even if storage isn't working perfectly, your app should still function:

### **Test Authentication & Onboarding:**
1. **Open**: http://localhost:8081
2. **Sign up** with a real email
3. **Complete onboarding** (skip avatar upload if it fails)
4. **Verify** that everything else works

The core functionality (auth, profile creation, onboarding) should work perfectly even without avatar uploads.

## 🔧 **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:**

### **If No Buckets Appear:**
- Bucket wasn't actually created
- You're in the wrong Supabase project
- Browser cache issue (try refresh)

### **If Bucket Exists But Tests Fail:**
- Bucket permissions not set correctly
- API keys don't have storage access
- RLS policies blocking access

### **If Uploads Fail:**
- Bucket not set to public
- Missing storage policies
- File size/type restrictions

## 📝 **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Manual verification** (above steps)
2. **Report findings** to me
3. **Test mobile app** regardless of storage status
4. **Fix storage** based on what we find

Your app's core functionality should be working perfectly - storage is just the final piece!
